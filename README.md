## Description

_My Website has been written for personal purposes only and is not for profit. Use of simple HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery and Javascript have been used to create a web game with simple input -> return loop.  The user inputs a number and PingponG returns a count of number up to the number the user input.  However, it replaces every divisible of 3, 5 and 15 with ping, pong or pingpong._
